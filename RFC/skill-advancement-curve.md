# RFC: Skill Advancement on a Curve

To advance a level, PCs need (Level * 5) checks. I.e.,

From | To | Checks
-----|----|-------
L1 | L2 | 5
L2 | L3 | 10
L3 | L4 | 15
L4 | L5 | 20
L5 | L6 | 25
L6 | L7 | 30

JP: We haven't tried this out yet? Or are we currently using this?

JP: But what I found most compelling about our conversation at the pub was that what we are lacking is good feel of actual progression...what's the tangible benefit of a 3 over a 4 for the player?

JP: We touched on this some by adding the ability to specify multiple goals, one per level, and while that has it's good points, I'm not convinced that it's enough.
