# RFC: Compromise Dice

To represent a lingering state of badness (e.g., player injury, bad luck,
bad air), use Compromise dice.

Name        | Dice
---------   |------
Compromised | -1d12
Disabled    | -2d12
Cursed      | -3d12

> It's reasonable for you to climb the ladder, but remember that you're
cursed.

JP: I'm +1 on trying this out -- this seems like a simple mechanic that parallels epic dice.  And it's subtractive rather than additive so it balances.  Seems like an easy way to model injury, for example.
