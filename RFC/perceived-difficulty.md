# RFC: Perceived difficulty

Sometimes PCs encounter an unfamiliar situation, and assigning difficulty
may give away more information than the GM wants to.

For example, a PC and NPC are in a tavern. The NPC Bart, looking for a
fight, intentionally knocks over the PC's ale. Now Bart doesn't look like
much, just a weedy, unkept little street urchin. But in fact Bart is an
80-year-old, Level 7 Dark Elf in disguise, and half the fun of this scene is
figuring that out.

With fully transparent difficulty, the GM might say:

> It's unlikely that you'll land a punch on Bart.

Immediately, the PC with L2 Pugilism will smell a rat, and a good PC may
renegotiate. Instead, say:

> It *seems to you* that it will be easy to punch this little punk.

JP: This seems straightforward to me, and I think I do this sometimes, but we haven't formally agreed on the mechanic?
