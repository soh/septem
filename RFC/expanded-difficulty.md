# RFC: Expanded Difficulty

As we add dice to the standard 100, a top-end of daunting becomes less
daunting. We need either to pull out some assistive dice (Cooperation
& Epic), or to increase difficulty levels.

Name           | Roll
----           |------
Easy           | 10
Reasonable     | 20
Chancy         | 40
Hard           | 60
Unlikely       | 80
Daunting       | 90
Impossible     | 125
Legendary      | 150
Miraculous     | 175
Inconceivable  | 200

JP: Trying math:

Player Skill (d100): 1-100
Cooperation   (6d6): 6-36  (3.5*6=21)
Epic         (3d12): 3-36  (6.5*3=19.5)

                   : 10-172

Party Coop?  (6d6?)

Would bring it up to 200ish
