# RFC: Epic Cooperation

The GM may award Epic dice for cooperation attempts that warrant it.
Warrantable attempts must be accompanied by a compelling narrative from
the cooperating PC.

This is another level in a dice arms race, for sure, and we shouldn't do it
lightly.

JP: I really like the idea of encouraging cooperation in actions -- but I'm actually more concerned about it interferring than about the dice.  In the sense of, player 1 is trying to do 'a', but player '2' has an idea to 'cooperate' on the action turning it into 'b'.  I think we have to try it out and see how it works.
