# RFC: Hidden Results

Sometimes a player is attempting something they should not or cannot know the absolute success or failure of.

A classic example is searching for a trap.

* GM: "The only remarkable thing about the long stretch of hallway between the elevator and the vault door is how featureless it is."
* PC: "I advance slowly, searching for any kind of alarms, sensors or triggers that I can detect with my upgraded mark *three* sensor array."
* GM: "That's a good package, it's reasonable that you should spot any civilian security packages that have been placed in the walls...of course, if they are paranoid and have the right connections, it'd be hard to detect military grade alarms..."

At this point, if the player rolls and sees the result, the know absolutely:

* If they find nothing and
  * Rolled < 20
    * Probably safe, or maybe a silent alarm?
  * Rolled > 20 < 60
    * Probably no civilian traps, but maybe there is still a military trap?
  * Rolled >= 60
    * It's safe

This is considerably more information than if they roll behind the GM's screen, in which case the GM can provide them with as much or little assurance as seems appropriate based on how they did, how well they think they did, and what happens:

* GM: "That's a good package, it's reasonable that you should spot any civilian security packages that have been placed in the walls...of course, if they are paranoid and have the right connections, it'd be hard to detect military grade alarms...*of course you won't know what you don't find...*"

In some cases, it's helpful for a little gesture from the GM to indicate that they want the roll to be behind the screen...

* catastrophic failure: (likely triggered something, might be audible or not...)
  * at the GM's discretion, maybe there is a trap/alarm, even if they hadn't planned on one?  Does the game need a little kick at this moment, or is it more important that the players progress toward their goal?
    * "You detect nothing, and take a check." (GM contemplates security response for the silent alarm)
    * "You've accidentally wiped your controller, it'll take five minutes or so to reset from local backups before your sensor package is back up.  And take a check"

* failure: "The corridor looks safe, you don't detect any traps or alarms"
* success: "All your scans are clear, there's nothing here"
* success: "You've detected three active heat sensors along the corridor"

* critical success: "You're picking up readings that match with a Rayco Systems Elliminator security installation; it's an active heat scan detector linked to pop out turrets. Fortunately you know some factory codes you could try. Also, take a check."

The player does still get some 'meta' information from knowing that they get a check, but it's all tied to the story dialogue rather than gaming information from the knowledge of the roll, and in most cases they have to proceed with the tension of uncertainty.

## Variation, Delayed Action

Some actions are intended to take place at a future time.

* PC: "I quickly set up one of Gromby's explosive dust traps to trigger on the door opening more than *two* feet."
* GM: "There's a chance you can get that in place quickly."

A critical failure is pretty obvious...Gromby's explosive dust immediately does so...

But the actual success or failure could go several ways, it could be immediately obvious.  "You don't have enough wire."  Or it could just fail to work when the guards come in ten minutes later.

That last case is not something the PC should know ahead of time.

One way to deal with this is to hide the role at the time the trap is set, the other is to delay the roll until a future point when the trap is actually engaged.

This can be tricky if the players have moved on to another area and are no longer aware of the door trap.  In that case, a hidden roll is probably best.

GM: "There's a chance you can get that in place quickly; but you won't really know if it works until you hear the explosion..."

Another example:

* PC: "Well, we can't wait here to targe the incoming pirate ship, we've got to get back to the lab before test subjects one through three breach their containment vessels.  During my *three* year tour in the marines, not a month went by when I wasn't re-programming the targetting systems on our destroyer; I bet I can get the station batteries set up to remotely defend against incoming missles and target the ship's power plant."

If they player's coding is bad, should they know immediately?  Or should the test come when the pirates lob missles at the base?

* GM: "You hear the proximity sirens; something is incoming.  Time to see how well your code is working..."
