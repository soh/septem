# Action

Action is the core of Septem. The stages of action are:

1. Setup
    * GM sets up the scene
1. Pitch
    * PC makes an initial pitch
    * GM request details, if necessary
    * PC describes action and skill
    * GM assigns difficulty and effect
1. Negotiation
    * PC may counters or readjusts
    * GM may reassign difficulty or effect
1. Action
    * PC rolls
    * GM describes the effect of action

### Setup

Setup is all narrative. It must be done well enough to allow PCs to decide
what action to take next.

### Pitch & negotiation

This is a back-and-forth discussion between GM and PC. It models the PC's
inner dialogue while she contemplates her action. The result of this
is a clear next action, with difficulty assigned to it.

### Action

Action starts with a PC roll and ends with the GM describing the game world
effects of that action.

## Difficulty

During gameplay the GM assigns and communicates difficulty ratings to PCs.
Assigning difficulty is the mother of complexity. Septem routes around that
complexity by putting it all in the hands of the GM.

Communicating difficulty is done with words, as part of the narrative.

### Difficulty levels

Name           |    Roll
----           |-   -----
Easy           |    10
Reasonable     |    20
Chancy         |    40
Hard           |    60
Unlikely       |    80
Daunting       |    90

### Difficulty stages

Often a simple success/failure result isn't enough. The PC may be trying
something complicated, or the GM may want to increase narrative tension.
Expanding on the previous lock-picking example, a GM might say:

> It will be easy for you to tell if you've succeeded in opening the lock,
> reasonable not to break your picks, chancy to actually get it open, and
> hard to end up with a functioning lock you can keep.

## Skill use & dice rolls

A full roll consists of Execution + Cooperation + Epicness.

Name           | Roll
----           |------
Execution      | d100
Cooperation    | (1-6)d6
Epicness       | (1-3)d12

### Execution dice

A d100 represents how well you execute a skill attempt.

#### Critical rolls

An extremely good or poor Execution roll is critical, and special things
happen.

Roll | Result
-----|----
1 - 9  | Critical failure
90 - 100 | Critical success

Any roll of 1-9 is a critical failure. The PC's action automatically fails,
and the PC earns a skill check. Adding cooperation and epic dice can temper
some of the consequences of a critical failure, but the attempt still fails.

Any roll of 90-100 is a critical success. The PC's action automatically
succeeds, and the PC earns a check. Adding cooperation and epic dice to a
roll may push the final result over 90, but that does not make it a check.

### Cooperation dice

Cooperation allows players to roll additional dice to help their fellow
players.

Each PC has 6d6 Cooperation dice, all of which start as Unavailable at the
beginning of a game session and become Available during play.

Any Available Cooperation dice may be rolled for any skill attempt by
another PC. Once rolled, these dice again become Unavailable. Unavailable
dice are made Available one at a time as PCs make their own skill attempts.

### Epic dice

Epic dice reward derring-do, panache, and abject stupidity. For any proposed
action the GM may make a judgement of Epicness, allowing the PC to add more
dice to their skill attempt. Epic dice are communicated using words:

Name     | Dice
---------|------
Cool     | +1d12
Awesome  | +2d12
Epic     | +3d12

> It will be daunting for you to dive off the cliff, throw a rope around the
Harpy's neck as it flies below you, and hang on. But it will be epic if you
pull it off.

## Skills

Skills can be whatever the PC and GM agree on. Skills max at L7. Level 1
skills are weak and common; level 7 skills are rare and legendary. A PC
playing weekly and making heavy use of one skill might take years to advance
from L1 to L7. A single L7 skill defines a character; generations will
remember her.

To advance a level, PCs need 10 checks.

Level     | Description
----------|- -
Unskilled | What you think you know about the skill does you more harm than good.
L1        | You can avoid the worst mistakes.
L2 - L7   | Your skill is working.
