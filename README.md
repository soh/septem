## A quick peek

Let's take a quick peek at a game session. This is what a simple exchange might sound like:

Role  | Action
---|--
GM | You see a chest. It appears locked with a padlock.
PC | I pick the lock.
GM | How do you do that?
PC | I think back to the 2 summers I spent with Uncle Fester on the farm. He taught me a lot about padlocks, mostly by chaining me to a radiator in the basement.
GM | I'd say you have a good chance of picking this lock.
   | [ sounds of dice ]
GM | Oooh, no, it's of a type you've not encountered before. You can almost feel the last pin falling into place, but none of your picks are long enough.

Note that you don't see any discussion of numbers. In fact, if you didn't
hear the dice rolling, it sounds like people making up a story on the fly.
All mechanics and rules are accomplished within the narrative.

Pope jokes aside, our first three goals are deadly earnest:

0. Simple enablement of human decisions.
0. Minimal numbers, metrics, and lookups.
0. Stay in Character Voice, not Player Voice.

Let's break down how the same scenario works mechanically:

Action | Mechanic
---|--|
"You see a chest ..."   | GM is describing a simple scenario
"I pick the lock."      | PC starts their Pitch
"How do you do that?"   | GM ask for details
"I think back to ..."   | PC indicates they have a Lock Picking skill of 2
"I'd say you have ..."  | GM indicates that a roll over 40 will be successful
[ sounds of dice ]      | PC rolls D100
"So ..."                | Depending on the PC's roll, many things are possible

* 08 (critical failure): "Your pick breaks off inside the lock, which seems to inhale it with a *snick*."
* 15 (failure): "This lock is much more complex then any you've seen. You're not even sure where to start."
* 44 (success, barely): "The lock is a crusty old thing, but you get it open without much trouble."
* 94 (critical success): "With a deft application of skill, the lock falls open in your hands. It's a strong padlock in good condition. Add it to your gear if you like."

### Audience

Septem requires judgement, trust, and experience. It is silent on many
things over which other gaming systems spill barrels of ink. This is a
feature. A poor GM may flounder in Septem's lack of structure, but a good GM
may find tremendous freedom.
